            <h2> Requirements For Hunting in New York</h2>
            <p class="requirementstext">NYS requires a 7 hour course in order to become a registered hunter in the state. 
                The course covers the basics of how fire arms work, hunting saftey practices, and other information
                needed before going on your first hunt</p>
            <p class="requirementstext">Once the hunter education course is completed one can apply for a nys hunting license.
                A regular hunting license only covers White Tail Deer, Bears & small game.
                Seperate licenses are required for turkey and waterfowl.
                A Hunter must check state limits for the number of animals that can be harvested as yearly
                limits are based on current population numbers and wildlife management goals.
            </p>
            <p class="requirementstext"> A NYS hunting license does not act as a NYS gun license. Anyone looking to hunt with firearms will
                require a seperate NYs firearms license. However, one does not need a firearm to hunt as there are
                other options available for instance bows and air rifles are other options for those not looking to
                use firearms.
