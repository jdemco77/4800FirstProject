                    <li>3 cups bread flour</li>
                    <li>1 tbsp. kosher salt</li>
                    <li>1 tbsp. black pepper</li>
                    <li>1 tsp. paprika</li>
                    <li>1 tsp. garlic powder</li>
                    <li>1 pinch cayenne</li>
                    <li>3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                    <li>2 cups whole milk</li>
                    <li>1 stick melted butter</li>
                    <li>1 tsp. kosher salt</li>
                    <li>1 tbsp. dried yeast</li>
                    <li>1 tbsp. granulated sugar</li>
                    <li>1 tsp. vanilla extract</li>
                    <li>3 eggs</li>
                </ul>
                <hr>
                <p style="text-align:center">Instructions</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Cut the breasts into two strips lengthwise. Soak them in buttermilk for 2 hours or overnight.
                        This allows the acid to tenderize the meat.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>For the waffles, pour the milk, butter, eggs, sugar, and vanilla into a saucepan. Place the
                        saucepan on medium-low heat until the mixture reaches 110 degrees. When temperature is reached,
                        remove batter from heat and mix in the yeast. Let yeast activate for about 10 minutes, or until
                        the mixture starts to foam.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>When the yeast is activated, transfer the batter to a mixing bowl and whisk in the flour and
                        salt. When the flour is fully incorporated into the liquid, cover with plastic wrap and set
                        aside for 1 to 2 hours. This allows the gluten to develop.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>When the batter is ready and bubbly, pour it into a waffle iron. Follow your waffle maker’s
                        directions (mine calls for one cup of batter per waffle). The batter will be thick and gummy, so
                        try your best to distribute evenly. Cook until golden brown.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Mix all the dry ingredients for the pheasant into a shallow dish and whisk together thoroughly.
                        Place dripping wet pieces of pheasant into the flour mixture. Firmly press the mixture into the
                        meat. This will make sure a good layer of batter coats the meat and gives it a proper crust.
                        Carefully drop fillets into 350-degree oil for about 5 minutes or until golden brown.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Coordinate cooking waffles and strips simultaneously. Serve warm waffles with two strips of
                        fried pheasant on top of each. Add a dollop of butter and cover in warm maple syrup.</li>

                <hr>
                <p style="text-align:center">Instructions</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Here’s how to get a flat iron steak. On one side of the shoulder blade there is a bone ridge or
                        protrusion that runs down the middle, dividing the meat roughly in half. One side of the paddle
                        is wider than the other and this is where you’ll find the flat iron, against the shoulder blade,
                        under the chuck roast. Use a sharp knife and slice it off the bone. The muscle connects to the
                        joint with the humorous bone so you might find it easier to cut the shank cut away at the joint
                        before starting. Next, you’ll need to trim the strip of silverskin that runs through the middle;
                        it will resemble the tendon in a turkey tenderloin. The easiest method for doing this is to hold
                        your knife at a 45-degree angle between the meat and the silverskin and push it down the
                        tissue’s length. It should feel like slicing fish meat away from the skin. When you are
                        finished, flip the flat iron over and take the tendon off the other side. You should end up with
                        two thin steaks from each shoulder blade.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Season the venison by blending the salt, pepper, garlic, rosemary, and lemon zest. Sprinkle this
                        rub over the flat iron steaks before cooking. If time allows, do this step an hour or two in
                        advance.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Preheat an oven to 350 degrees.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Just before cooking, pour the lemon juice and honey into a small bowl and blend. Add the sliced
                        red onion and allow it to marinate for 30 minutes before serving.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>In a separate bowl, blend the crème fraiche, creole mustard, and grated parmesan. Taste and add
                        more mustard if desired. Set aside.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Slice a French baguette into quarters, and then again in half lengthwise so that you have eight
                        pieces of bread. Season with salt, pepper, and drizzle with olive oil. Bake in the oven for 15
                        minutes or until toasted.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Remove the venison steaks from the refrigerator at least 30 minutes before cooking. Pre-heat a
                        cast iron skillet or stainless-steel sauté pan over high heat. Add a glug of oil and swirl to
                        coat the bottom. Lay each steak down, leaving room in between each. You will probably have to
                        work in batches. Sear each side for 2 minutes, then flip. Cook for another 2 minutes, or longer
                        depending on how thick your steaks are. Aim for internal temperature of 125-128 degrees for
                        medium-rare.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>While the steaks rest, assemble the sandwiches. Slather each piece of bread with the
                        mustard-cream and layer with lettuce and pickled onions.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Thinly slice the venison steaks at a 45-degree angle to increase the width of each piece. Serve
                        on top of the toasted bread. Garnish with more grated parmesan if desired.</li>

                        <li>2 lbs ground bear meat</li>
                        <li>Your favorite hamburger seasoning</li>
                        <li>Parmesan cheese</li>
                        <li>Temperature gauge</li>
                    </ul>
                    <hr>
                    <p style="text-align:center">Instructions</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Add in a generous amount of hamburger seasoning and parmesan cheese on top of your ground meat. I generally throw enough on to cover the whole top completely. From here, you are going to want to knead the seasoning into the meat until it is combined evenly. If there looks like there isn't enough, add more seasoning or cheese as you go through and knead.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>I like to use a scale after this to break the meat up into quarter-pound patties. If you want them bigger, that is fine. There are no rules here!</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Whether you cook this on a grill or in a pan, that is entirely up to you. Personally, I like the burger better on the grill. Whichever way you choose, make sure you cook the burger until it is well done. I will cook the patty until the inside temp reaches 170 degrees. You don't want to risk getting trichinosis.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Add whatever fixings you would like and enjoy! I like cheese, avocado, lettuce, red onion and a bit of honey BBQ sauce!</li>
